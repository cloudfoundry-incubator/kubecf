  # Trigger the workflow when PRs pushed; we still run the workflow files from
  # the master branch, to ensure that malicious actors cannot exfiltrate any
  # secrets.  It is important that we don't expose any secrets to the checked-
  # out code, both in the environment as well as on disk (i.e. we must run
  # actions/checkout with persist-credentials: false).
