# Instance sizing takes precedence over the high_availability property. I.e. setting the

#
# It is also possible to specify custom affinity rules for each instance group. If no rule
# is provided, then each group as anti-affinity to itself, to try to spread the pods between
# different nodes. In addition diego-cell and router also have anti-affinity to each other.
#
# The default rules look like this:

# sizing:
#   sample_group:
#     affinity:
#       podAntiAffinity:
#         preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
#         - weight: 100
